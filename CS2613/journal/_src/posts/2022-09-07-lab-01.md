LAb 01
========

What new concepts (if any) did you learn about in this lab?
-----------------------------------------------------------

I learned new concepts such as version control systems, Delta-based version control, frog and git background (Subversion, Stage, Commit, Modify).

If you have used a version control system other than git before, what is one important difference between that system and git?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I have used Apache Subversion, one important difference is that git has a distributed model and SVN has a centralized model.

If you have used git before, what is one thing about git you like, and one you don't like?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like the branching capability of git, and I don't like to use git on windows because it is slow.

If you have ever used a version control system before, what strategies have you used to keep version of files?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like to keep copies of files because I can easily track using folder name and modified dates. Also, if the files get corrupted I can replace always.
