JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects and a JavaScript method is a property containing a function defintion <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp\" title=\"JavaScript Methods\">JavaScript Methods</a>. In JavaScript, \"<code>this</code>\" keyword refers to an object. In JavaScript, when the function method is called as \"<code>object.method()</code>\", the special variable \"<code>this</code>\" is defined to mean the current object. Also, I learned about Prototypes. Prototypes are the mechanism by whic JavaScript objects inherits features from one another <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes\" title=\"JavaScript Prototype\">Prototype</a>. I practiced this concept using an example method which inherited from the prototype, but the fields were not inherited. It is helpful because, it allows to easily define methods to all instances of a particular object. Moreover, I learned about JavaScript classes which is not very similar to Java classes. JavaScript version \"<code>ES2015</code>\", now provides the \"<code>class</code>\" keyword to concisely generate constructors and prototypes. In JavaScript, \"<code>new</code>\" keyword is used along with the prototype property of a constructor. Below is the sample practice program I used in the lab to practice the concept,</p>\n\n<pre>\nfunction Time(hours, mins){\n    this.hours=hours;\n    this.mins=mins;\n}\n\nTime.prototype.plus=function (other) {\n    let raw=timePlus(this,other);\n    return new Time(raw.hours, raw.mins);\n}\n\nG = new Time(20,59);\nH = new Time(11,11);\n\nI=G.plus(H);\nconsole.log(I);</pre>\n\n<p>Also, I learned about the JavaScript arrays which are implemented as objects and because of that sometime their behaviour is surprising. I practiced the array concept using few practice problems given in the lab exercises. The first practice program I wrote was to calculate the sum if a range of an array whichi is easier. Furthermore, I learned about array methods. JavaScript has some higher order methods that can take functions as arguments. Also, JavaScript \"\n <i>reduce</i>\" function is similar to \"\n <i>foldl</i>\" in racket. \"\n <i>forEach</i>\" function is different from \"\n <i>map</i>\" function in racket because it does not produce a list, however, it helps to iterate through the list with giving out of bound errors.
